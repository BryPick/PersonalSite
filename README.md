## Bryan Pickering's Personal Site

A personal site of mine built as a single page React application. I wanted to practice the React knowledge that I gained by making a personal website.

### Description
This personal site of mine contains 5 sections: "About Me", "Skills", "Experience", "Projects", "Contact". Each section is contained on the same page. The site also has small amounts of animation to give the site a little bit of its own style.

### Build Environment
-  [x] React 16.8.6 +
-  [x] Node 10.14.2 +
-  [x] NPM 6.5.0 +

### Installation
Download the repository then run npm install to install the packages
```bash
npm install
```

Run npm start to start the localhost server
```bash
npm start
```
